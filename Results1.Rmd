### Part 1: Sample recruitment and demographic and medical information

The survey recruitment ran between February 18, 2022 and September 15,
2022. The anonymous survey link that was shared on social media resulted
in `r nrow(raw_data)` visits to the front page with the information
about they study. The link was circulated via cancer charity email
newsletters and across cancer organisations from the European region.
Social media posts were promoted on Facebook and Instagram aiming at age
range between 18 and 39 years, and in particular Eeastern European
countries, which had the lowest participation. The number of
participants who reviewed the information and agreed to participate was
`r sum(raw_data$consent, na.rm = TRUE) - raw_data %>% filter(check != 4) %>% nrow()`.
Number of participants who completed the survey was
`r raw_data %>% filter(lastpage %in% c(9:10)) %>% nrow()` or
`r round((raw_data %>% filter(lastpage %in% c(9:10)) %>% nrow())/(sum(raw_data$consent, na.rm = TRUE) - raw_data %>% filter(check != 4) %>% nrow())*100,1)`%
of those who consented.

Overall, 47 countries were represented and all 27 European Union
members, although several had only 1 participant. The complete table can
be viewed below with corresponding number of participants in each
country. The codes are ISO-3 country codes
[source](https://www.iban.com/country-codes). Among the Non-EU countries
we have OTH = Other; individuals had either wished not to respond, or
came from a country that was not listed.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data %>%
  dplyr::select(dem_nationality, eu) %>%
  filter(eu == "EU") %>%
  group_by(dem_nationality) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(sum = sum(n),
         prop = n/sum,
         prop = round(prop, 2)) %>%
  dplyr::select(-sum) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Country code", "N", "Proportion"), caption = "EU Countries") %>%
  kable_styling("hover", full_width = FALSE, position = "float_left")

data %>%
  dplyr::select(dem_nationality, eu) %>%
  filter(eu != "EU") %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  group_by(dem_nationality) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(sum = sum(n),
         prop = n/sum,
         prop = round(prop, 2)) %>%
  dplyr::select(-sum) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Country code", "N", "Proportion"), caption = "Non-EU Countries") %>%
  kable_styling("hover", full_width = FALSE, position = "right")
```

### Region groupings

For the purposes of comparative analyses we grouped individuals from
different countries into 6 distinct country clusters. These clusters are
based on @ferreira2018 analyses of healthcare indices across the EU
countries. @ferreira2018 used data from the WHO and Eurostat databases
and grouped countries into the following clusters: Austria-Germany,
Central and Northern countries, Southern countries, Eastern countries A,
and Eastern countries B. The classification resulted from an extensive
overview of the literature on health determinants, and combines factor,
cluster, and descriptive analyses. The grouping was based on 1) health
service provision, 2) generation of health resources (investment and
training), and 3) health financing in respective countries. In addition,
the authors also considered GDP, real GDP Growth Rate and Governmental
Debt. Because our data included individuals from outside the EU, we
resultantly grouped all the remaining countries into the 6th cluster
(see Figure 1). Such clustering allowed us to make more meaningful
comparisons of results and can guide health policy assessments and
recommendations.

                                dem_nationality == "FRA" | dem_nationality == "IRL" |
                                dem_nationality == "SWE" | dem_nationality == "GBR" ~ "2 - Central and Northern countries",

Participants were on average 30 years, ranging between 18 and 61 years
at the time of participation. Just over half, 51.9% identified as
females, and 47.5% identified as male. Further details about the
demographic information can be viewed in Table 1.3.

                          labels = c("Male", "Female", "Other", "Prefer not to answer")),
         dem_religion = factor(dem_religion, 
                               levels = c(0:8, 999),

                          labels = c("Single", "In a relationship", "Married/Common-Law", "Separated/Divorced","Prefer not to answer")),
         dem_child = factor(dem_child, 
                               levels = c(0, 1, 999),
                               labels = c("Yes", "No", "Prefer not to answer")))

table1(~ dem_age + dem_sex + dem_religion + dem_edu + dem_relationship + dem_child,
       data = table_data_1)
```

*NOTE*: The number in the table might be lower than the number of
complete responses reported on the front page. This is because the
analyses are limited to participants who are between 18 and 65 years of
age, have correctly consented and responded to the bot check question.

### Medical information

All participants were asked to self-report medical information. On
average participants were diagnosed at 23.4 years. Less than 9% (62) of
the participants have been diagnosed before the age of 15. The purpose
of the study was to capture adolescence and young adults. Figure 2 shows
the distribution of ages at diagnosis.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=3, fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Fig. 1.2: Distribution of age at diagnosis"}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = med_cancerage)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), bins = 30, color = "black", fill="lightblue") +
  geom_density(fill = "#FF6666", alpha = 0.2) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 40, by=2)) +
  labs(title = " ",
       x = "Age at diagnosis",
       y = "Density/Count")

#The table below shows the cumulative number of participants below a certain age at diagnosis.
# data %>%
#   dplyr::select(med_cancerage) %>%
#   filter(med_cancerage < 15) %>%
#   group_by(med_cancerage) %>%
#   count() %>%
#   ungroup() %>%
#   mutate(cum.sum = cumsum(n)) %>%
#   kable(col.names = c("Age at diag.", "N", "Cumulative sum")) %>%
#   kable_styling("hover", full_width = FALSE, latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

The majority of our participants, 59.2% were treated in adult settings,
20.3% were treated in specialist young adult settings, and 7.4% were
treated primarily in the pediatric settings. Almost 63% of participants
were still in active treatment, and 32.5% reported that their treatment
did not directly cause infertility. More medical information is
presented in Table X and the types of diagnoses reported are summarized
in Table 1.4.

# PART 2: Fertility preservation service: Awareness, satisfaction, and preferences

### Were you informed that infertility is a late effect risk?

Participants were first asked if their treatment posed a risk to
fertility and subsequently if fertility was discussed as a late effect.
The majority of the participants reported having discussed infertility
as a possible late effect, however, a small proportion (12%) did not
discuss it despite having received fertility-compromising medical
treatment. See Figure 3 for a complete breakdown.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Fig. 2.1: Fertility discussions based on the risk of infertility", fig.align='center'}
# This is the data table

  geom_text(aes(label = paste0("n = ", n), y = prop - 2), size = 3) +
  labs(title = " ", 
       y = "Proportion (%)",
       x = "Was fertility discussed?") +

        #panel.grid.major.x = element_line(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line())
```

### Discussion about fertility by country cluster

Observations were grouped into the country clusters and responses were
compared between these.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pt1 <- data %>%
  dplyr::select(awareness_1, dem_cluster) %>%
  mutate_all(as.factor)

chsq_awareness_1 <- infer::chisq_test(pt1, awareness_1 ~ dem_cluster)
```

There were significant differences in the proportion of individuals who
were informed about the possibility of infertility between the country
clusters, $\chi^2$ (`r chsq_awareness_1[[1,2]]`, `r nrow(pt1)`) =
`r round(chsq_awareness_1[[1,1]],2)`, *p* =
`r round(chsq_awareness_1[[1,3]],3)`, with effect size *Cramer V* =
`r round(cramerV(pt1$awareness_1, pt1$dem_cluster, bias.correct = TRUE),2)`.
Particularly in Cluster 4, Eastern European countries A, we see that the
majority of participants (53%) did not report having discussed
infertility. See Figure 4.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=5, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Fig. 2.2: Information about infertility by country cluster"}
data %>%
  dplyr::select(awareness_1, dem_cluster) %>%
  mutate(awareness_1 = factor(awareness_1,
                          levels = c(0, 1, 2),
                          labels = c("No", "Yes", "Don't \nremember"))) %>%
  group_by(awareness_1, dem_cluster) %>%
  count() %>%
  group_by(dem_cluster) %>%
  mutate(sum = sum(n),
         prop = n/sum,
         prop = round(prop, 2)*100) %>%
  dplyr::select(-sum) %>%
  mutate(awareness_1 = as.factor(awareness_1),
         awareness_1 = fct_reorder(awareness_1, prop)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = prop, y = awareness_1, fill = awareness_1)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(prop, "%"), x = prop + 11)) +
  labs(title = " ", 
       x = "Proportion",
       y = " ") + 
  xlim(0, 100) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 12.5) +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        strip.text = element_text(face = 'bold'),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_line()) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(begin = 0.3, end = 0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~dem_cluster, labeller = as_labeller(cluster_names))
```

Furthermore, participants reported the type of service they received
during treatment. Comparison was done based on the type of ward in order
to observe any differences between pediatric, young adult, and adult
services.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pt2 <- data %>%
  dplyr::select(awareness_1, med_wheretx) %>%
  mutate_all(as.factor)

chsq_awareness_2 <- infer::chisq_test(pt2, awareness_1 ~ med_wheretx)
```

Significant differences were observed in the proportion of individuals
who were informed about the possibility of infertility between different
service type, $\chi^2$ (`r chsq_awareness_2[[1,2]]`, `r nrow(pt2)`) =
`r round(chsq_awareness_2[[1,1]],2)`, *p* =
`r round(chsq_awareness_2[[1,3]],3)`, with effect size *Cramer V* =
`r round(cramerV(pt2$awareness_1, pt2$med_wheretx, bias.correct = TRUE),2)`.
Fertility was discussed significantly less in the pediatric service
compared to young adult, adult, or mixed services. See Figure 5 for
complete breakdown.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=5, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Fig. 2.3: Fertility discussions based on the type of ward"}
data %>%
  dplyr::select(awareness_1, med_wheretx) %>%
  mutate(med_wheretx = factor(med_wheretx,
                               levels = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 999),
                               labels = c("Pediatric ward", "Young adult ward", "Adult ward", "Mixed service", "Prefer not to answer"))) %>%
  filter(med_wheretx != "Prefer not to answer") %>%
  mutate(awareness_1 = factor(awareness_1,
                          levels = c(0, 1, 2),
                          labels = c("No", "Yes", "Don't \nremember"))) %>%
  group_by(awareness_1, med_wheretx) %>%
  count() %>%
  group_by(med_wheretx) %>%
  mutate(sum = sum(n),
         prop = n/sum,
         prop = round(prop, 2)*100) %>%
  dplyr::select(-sum) %>%
  mutate(awareness_1 = as.factor(awareness_1),
         awareness_1 = fct_reorder(awareness_1, prop)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = prop, y = factor(awareness_1, level = c("Don't \nremember", "No",'Yes')), fill = awareness_1)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(prop, "%"), x = prop + 11)) +
  labs(title = " ", 
       x = "Proportion",
       y = " ") + 
  xlim(0, 100) +

### Information about medical options available for fertility preservation

In addition to having discussed fertility, participants were asked if
they also had a chance to discuss medical options for fertility
preservation. The majority, regardless of whether or not their treatment
posed risk to fertility, had the chance to discuss medical options.
However, 1 out of 4 participants whose fertility was compromised by
treatment did not discuss medical options for fertility preservation.
See Figure 2.4.

  facet_grid(~factor(med_txinfertility), labeller = as_labeller(response)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0("n = ", n), y = prop - 2), size = 3) +
  labs(title = " ", 
       y = "Proportion (%)",
       x = "Were medical options discussed?") +

        #panel.grid.major.x = element_line(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line())
```

Among individuals who were informed about medical options for fertility
preservation (*N* = 366), 26% were informed about this at the time of
diagnosis, and 54% some time after the diagnosis, but before the
treatment. See Table 2.1.

#### Table 2.1: At what point were you informed about medical options for fertility preservation?

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data %>%
  dplyr::select(contains("awareness")) %>%
  dplyr::select(awareness_3) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(awareness_3 = factor(awareness_3,
                          levels = c(1:5),
                          labels = c("At diagnosis", "After diagnosis, before treatment", "While in treatment", "After finishing treatment","Don't remember"))) %>%
  group_by(awareness_3) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(sum = sum(n),
         prop = n/sum,
         prop = paste0(round(prop, 2)*100, "%")) %>%
  dplyr::select(-sum) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Response", "N", "Proportion")) %>%
  kable_styling("hover", full_width = FALSE, latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

Furthermore, individual who were informed about fertility preservation
options reported that oncologist was most commonly the person to have
informed them and provided most relevant information (41%). Some
individuals reported educational material and cancer peer support were
the most informative sources. See Table 2.2.

#### Table 2.2: Who or what course provided the most relevant and useful information?

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data %>%
  dplyr::select(contains("awareness")) %>%
  dplyr::select(awareness_4) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(awareness_4 = factor(awareness_4,
                          levels = c(1:7),
                          labels = c("Oncologist", "Another HCP", "Educational material", "Friends/family", "Cancer charity/cancer peer support", "I sought information myself", "Other"))) %>%
  group_by(awareness_4) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup() %>%

  kable_styling("hover", full_width = FALSE, latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

### Access to fertility preservation by country clusters

Among our sample, 80% of those who were informed about fertility
preservation decided to pursue it.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pt3 <- data %>%
  dplyr::select(availability_1, dem_cluster) %>%
  mutate_all(as.factor) %>%
  drop_na()

chsq_awareness_3 <- infer::chisq_test(pt3, availability_1 ~ dem_cluster)
```

There were significant differences in the proportion of individuals who
accessed fertility preservation between the country clusters, $\chi^2$
(`r chsq_awareness_3[[1,2]]`, `r nrow(pt3)`) =
`r round(chsq_awareness_3[[1,1]],2)`, *p* \< 0.001,
<!-- `r round(chsq_awareness_3[[1,3]],4)`--> with effect size *Cramer V*
=
`r round(cramerV(pt3$availability_1, pt3$dem_cluster, bias.correct = TRUE),2)`.
The lowest access was reported in Cluster 5, Eastern European countries
B, where only 57% of participants reported accessing fertility
preservation services, compared to other clusters where a great majority
reported having accessed fertility preservation (See Figure 2.5).

```{r t-test for sex in acess, echo=FALSE}
t_test_acess <- data %>%
  dplyr::select(dem_sex, availability_1) %>%
  filter(dem_sex %in% c(1:2)) %>%
  filter(availability_1 %in% c(1:2)) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate_all(as.factor)

# table(t_test_acess$dem_sex, t_test_acess$availability_1)

chsq_awareness_acess <- infer::chisq_test(t_test_acess, availability_1 ~ dem_sex)

# t_test_acess %>%
#   ggplot(aes(y = availability_1, fill = dem_sex))+
#   geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

Among individuals who were informed about fertility preservation
options, significantly more men decided to pursue it compared to women
(*N* = 166 v. *N* = 127, $\chi^2$ (`r chsq_awareness_acess[[1,2]]`,
`r nrow(t_test_acess)`) = `r round(chsq_awareness_acess[[1,1]],2)`, *p*

### Satisfaction and preferences in receiving fertility-related information

Participants who received information about fertility preservation
options (*N* = 366) were asked how satisfied they were with the
provision of this information. The majority, 60%, was satisfied, 20%
were neither satisfied or dissatisfied, and 20 % were dissatisfied.
Regardless of the response, participants were asked to report what
factors contributed to their level of satisfaction. Short qualitative
answers were analysed for content and grouped by themes. Table 2.3
summarizes the responses. An independent samples t-test revealed no
significant differences in satisfaction levels (continuous value from 1
- 5) between men and women, *t*(352) = - 0.001, *p* = 0.99.

## Preference in receiving information related to fertility preservation

Individuals were asked to rank their preferences when gathering
information related to fertility preservation. Most people endorsed
**hard copies** (e.g. brochures, pamphlets, books) and **online written
communications**, such as dedicated websites as preferred (126 and 110
ranked it as first, respectively). These resources were followed by
communication face-to-face, virtual consultations, and least favorable
were online messenger and over the phone.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# data %>%
#   dplyr::select(contains("preference_source")) %>%
#   pivot_longer(cols = c(preference_source_1:preference_source_6),
#                names_to = "option",
#                values_to = "rank") %>%
#  # filter(rank == 1) %>%
#   group_by(option, rank) %>%
#   count() %>%
#   group_by(option) %>%
#   mutate(sum = sum(n),
#          prop = round(n/sum*100,1)) %>%
#   ggplot(aes(x = factor(rank), y = option, fill = n)) +
#   geom_tile() +
#   geom_text(aes(label = paste0(n, " "))) +
#   scale_fill_viridis_c() +
#   scale_y_discrete(limits=rev)
```

Participants also reported the level of importance of different parties
being involved in the decision-making process related to
fertility-preservation. In addition to fertility specialists and medical
oncologists, participants reported that psychologists are important too.

## Discussion: Fertility preservation awareness, access, satisfaction and preferences

The first part of our online survey aimed at establishing a general
understanding of the current levels of awareness of infertility as a
late effect of cancer treatment, awareness and access to medical options
for preserving fertility, and individual preferences in receiving
fertility-related information. Our results suggest that the majority of
young people received some form of communication related to fertility
from the health-care team. Despite that, it is important to note that
significant differences exist, in particular between country clusters
and treatment settings. Eastern European countries A cluster (including
Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Romania) reported
significantly fewer discussion about infertility as a potential late
effect. Similarly, fertility was significantly less discussed on the
pediatric wards compared to young adult, adult, or mixed service wards,
a findings in line with the existing literature (REF).

Literature suggests that fertility counselling or discussion occur at
relatively high rates, from 19 - 61% in the USA [@young2019a;
\@letourneau2012] or in an AYA sample in Japan (both samples included
female participants only), however, despite these consultations, rates
of actual access to procedures tend to be lower, from 4% in the USA to X
in the Japanese sample. Similar pattern has been observed in our study -
80% of informed individuals decided to pursue some sort of fertility
preservation, among these significantly fewer women compared to men.
Furthermore, we also observed significant differences between country
clusters, and particularly in European Countries B (Croatia, Czechia,
Estonia, Poland, Slovenia), 43% of participants did not opt for
fertility preservation.

Discussions related to fertility are important and need to happen early
on. Our participants reported having received information related to
fertility preservation either at the time of diagnosis or more commonly,
sometime before treatment. Some of our participants also reported having
learned about fertility preservation during or after treatment. A
similar findings has been reported by \@furui2019 who found that only
42% of the AYA sample received information on fertility preservation
methods pre-treatment. While it is important to consider and weigh the
urgency of treatment initiation against the need for fertility
preservation, the initial phases of receiving diagnosis can be
overwhelming (REF) and oncologists may place priority on controlling the
disease instead of fertility and similar psycho-social aspects (REF).
While the majority of our participants reported to be satisfied with
their fertility-preservation services, a proportion was not. At least in
part, some of reasons for dissatisfaction that were reported can be
addressed in the future (e.g. lack of adequate information, hidden
costs).

Some oncology centers readily employ multidisciplinary teams that helps
young patients navigate the challenges of illness, however, these are
not the norm (REF). Young people report the need for psychological
support in treatment and fertility decision-making [@logan2019a]. In
addition to having psychological support, our participants reported the
wish for the entire medical team to be involved (See Figure 2.6).

While not all cancer treatments pose direct direct risk to fertility, it
is important that fertility-related information is conveyed to patients
as they navigate through the initial phases of the illness. This should
be done by fertility specialist who work in tandem with the oncology
team, as well as psychological support, and parents or caregivers where
appropriate. Young people appreciate having agency and like to be
involved in the decision-making processes (REF). When providing them
with the relevant resources that go beyond face-to-face consultations
with experts, we should make sure to provide reliable informational
resources.

```

Quality of life was measured using the brief version of WHOQOL
[@whoqol]. The mean overall quality of life score was
`r round(mean(data$whoqol_total),2)` (*SD*
=`r round(sd(data$whoqol_total),2)`). Internal consistency (Cronbach
$\alpha$) for the entire sample was high
`r round(whoqol_total_alpha$total[[1]],2)`.

The scale also measures various sub-domains of quality of life. Physical
domain score: *M* = `r round(mean(data$whoqol_physical),2)` (*SD* =
`r round(sd(data$whoqol_physical),2)`). Internal consistency (Cronbach
$\alpha$) for the physical domain subscale sample was
`r round(whoqol_physical_alpha$total[[1]],2)`. Psychological domain
score: *M* = `r round(mean(data$whoqol_psych),2)` (*SD* =
`r round(sd(data$whoqol_psych),2)`). Internal consistency (Cronbach
$\alpha$) for the psychological domain subscale sample was
`r round(whoqol_psych_alpha$total[[1]],2)`. Social domain score: *M* =
`r round(mean(data$whoqol_social),2)` (*SD* =
`r round(sd(data$whoqol_social),2)`). Internal consistency (Cronbach
$\alpha$) for the social domain subscale sample was
`r round(whoqol_social_alpha$total[[1]],2)`. Environmental domain score:
*M* = `r round(mean(data$whoqol_environ),2)` (*SD* =
`r round(sd(data$whoqol_environ),2)`). Internal consistency (Cronbach
$\alpha$) for the social domain subscale sample was
`r round(whoqol_environ_alpha$total[[1]],2)`.

```{r t-test for sex in QOL, echo=FALSE, results=FALSE}
t_test_qol <- data %>%
  dplyr::select(dem_sex, whoqol_total, dem_cluster, dem_age, med_cancerage, med_currenttx, awareness_1) %>%

  filter(awareness_1 %in% c(0:1)) %>%
  mutate_at(c("dem_sex", "dem_cluster", "awareness_1", "med_currenttx"), as.factor)

t.test(whoqol_total ~ dem_sex, 
       data = t_test_qol,
       alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = TRUE)

t.test(whoqol_total ~ awareness_1, 
       data = t_test_qol,

lm_age <- lm(whoqol_total ~ med_cancerage,
             data = t_test_qol)
summary(lm_age)
```

Univariate analyses revealed that compared to women, men reported
significantly lower quality of life overall (*M* = 60.1 for women, *M* =
55.3 for men, *t*(615) = - 4.46, *p* \< 0.001). Across the entire
sample, quality of life did not differ based on whether or not fertility
had been discussed (*t*(374.1) = - 0.89, *p* = 0.373), however, quality
of life was significantly higher among individuals who were not in
treatment at the time of the study (*M* = 61.6 for out of treatment v.
*M* = 56.1 in-treatment, *t*(500) = 5.248, *p* \< 0.001). Lastly, higher
age at diagnoses was significantly associated with higher overall
quality of life (*F*(1, 615) = 5.651, *p* = 0.017).

In addition to the univariate analyses we ran an adjusted multilevel
linear model in order to account for the nesting structure of our data
within country clusters. Adjusting for age at diagnosis, sex, current
treatment status, quality of life differed significantly between those
who discussed fertility versus those who have not within Eastern
European B country cluster (*t* = 2.093, *p* = 0.036). The complete
model parameters can be viewed in Table 3.1. Figure 3.1 represents the
results visually.

### Feelings of depression and anxiety

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
phq_sum_alpha <- data %>%
  dplyr::select(phq_sq__1, phq_sq__2, phq_sq__3, phq_sq__4) %>%
  psych::alpha(check.keys = TRUE)

phq_anxiety_alpha <- data %>%
  dplyr::select(phq_sq__1, phq_sq__2) %>%
  psych::alpha(check.keys = TRUE)

phq_depression_alpha <- data %>%
  dplyr::select(phq_sq__3, phq_sq__4) %>%
  psych::alpha(check.keys = TRUE)

```

Feelings of depression and anxiety were measured using PHQ-4
[@kroenke2009]. The mean overall score for the psychological distress
was `r round(mean(data$phq_sum),2)` (*SD* =
`r round(sd(data$phq_sum),2)`). The mean score for anxiety subscale was
`r round(mean(data$phq_anxiety),2)` (*SD* =
`r round(sd(data$phq_anxiety),2)`), and
`r round(mean(data$phq_depression),2)` (*SD* =
`r round(sd(data$phq_depression),2)`) for depression subscale. Internal
consistency (Cronbach $\alpha$) for the overall score was
`r round(phq_anxiety_alpha$total[[1]],2)`, and
`r round(phq_sum_alpha$total[[1]],2)` and
`r round(phq_depression_alpha$total[[1]],2)` for anxiety and depression,
respectively.

Literature suggests that a cut-off score of ≥ 3 on the anxiety subscale
(known also as GAD-2) is reasonably sensitive in detecting generalized
anxiety disorder (88%), panic disorder (76%), social anxiety disorder
(70%), and posttraumatic stress disorder (59%) (REF Kroenke et al.,
2007). Similarly, a cut-off score of ≥ 3 on the depression subscale
(known also as PHQ-2) is 83% sensitive and 90% specific in detecting
major depressive disorder (REF Kroenke et al., 2003).

In our sample 59% (*N* = 195) of men and 44% (*N* = 154) of women
endorsed scores of 6 or above indicating presence of psychological
distress (results not shown). A higher proportion of participants who
were in treatment reported clinical levels of psychological distress
compared to those not in treatment (58% v. 37%, respectively). Table 3.2
shows the mean values and proportions scoring in the clinical range
based on their treatment status.

Overall levels of distressed were compared on several variables. Men in
our sample reported significantly higher levels of distress compared to
women (*M* = 5.87 for men, *M* = 4.92 for women, *t*(610) = 4.29, *p* \<
0.001). Across the sample, psychological distress did not significantly
differ based on whether or not fertility had been discussed (*t*(374.8)
= 0.72, *p* = 0.468), however, psychological distress was significantly
higher among individuals who were in treatment at the time of the study
compared to those not in treatment (*M* = 5.91 in-treatment v. *M* =
4.36 for out of treatment, *t*(420.5) = - 6.69, *p* \< 0.001). Neither
age at diagnosis (*F*(1, 615) = 0.251, *p* = 0.617), nor age at the time
of the study were associated with higher psychological distress (*F*(1,
615) = 0.779, *p* = 0.378).

A multilevel linear model, adjusting for age at diagnosis, sex, current
treatment status was used to assess the psychological distress between
country clusters and fertility preservation awareness. Eastern European
countries B were the only country cluster where fertility discussions
showed significant association with the level of psychological distress
(*t* = -2.129, *p* = 0.0337). Table 3.2 contains the complete model
parameters, while Figure 3.2 shows the results visually.

### Perceived changes in quality of life and well-being since the time of diagnosis

Participants were asked to think and reflect about their life with
illness and to report how their feelings of anxiety, depression, and
quality of life have changed since the diagnosis. In particular, we
looked at those who have already completed treatment (*N* = 246).
Anxiety has worsened for 39%, depression for 35% while quality of life
improved for 33%. See Figure 3.3 for a complete breakdown.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Fig. 3.3: Perceived change in anxiety, depression, and quality of life since diagnosis"}
data %>%
  filter(med_currenttx == 0) %>%
  dplyr::select(contains("qol_change")) %>%
  rename(`Quality of life` = qol_change_sq__1, 
         Depression = qol_change_sq__2,
         Anxiety = qol_change_sq__3) %>%

               names_to = "construct",
               values_to = "response") %>%

                              "It \nimproved"))
```

Furthermore, participants were asked if and to what extent
fertility-related worries or problems impact their feelings of anxiety,
depression, quality of life, and romantic relationships.
Fertility-related worries and concerns greatly impacted the feelings of
anxiety and depression among 27% of participants, while 24% reported
negative impact on their romantic relationship, and 17% reported
negative impact on their quality of life. See Figure 3.4 for a complete
breakdown.

## Discussion: Quality of life and well-being

Quality of life and psychological distress are important concepts in the
field of AYA psycho-social oncology and a top priority for research as
reported by patients (LINDT). The results based on our survey indicate
that close to 1 in 2 respondents report some form of clinically relevant
psychological distress. In particular we see that both quality of life
and psychological distress are more impacted among individuals who are
currently in treatment. While the level of distress may be normal for
young people who are in treatment, over a third of young people who have
already completed treatment continues to report increased levels of
anxiety and depressive symptomatology. Prolonged and increased distress
has been reported in the literature and in particular, feelings of
anxiety tend to be more common than symptoms of depression (kosir). The
aim of our survey was to not to quantify or identify those who are
clinically depressed or anxious, nevertheless, our findings lend further
insight into the nature of psychological distress experienced by AYAs
with lived experience.

Receiving a diagnosis of cancer at an early age is particularly
challenging due to the many developmental processes and milestones that
young people are trying to achieve. Illness can compromise many aspects
of one's life, from romantic relationships (REF) to school and
vocational attainment (REF), both short- and long-term. Among the most
altering late-effects of cancer treatment are fertility-related
problems. Fertility can thus be intricately linked with one's quality of
life and well-being. In order to explore this relationship we ran
multivariate analyses that clustered individuals based on the health
care systems and looked for differences in quality of life and
psychological distress. In both cases we've seen a significant
difference in Eastern European countries B (Croatia, Czechia, Estonia,
Poland, Slovenia). Those who reported having discussion about fertility
had significantly higher quality of life, and significantly lower level
of psychological distress, controlling for treatment status, age at
diagnosis and sex. Within the same country cluster it is also where we
observed that the majority did not opt to preserve fertility (see Fig.
2.5) so that may be a potential mediator of the effect we observe in
this clus[@lambertini2020]ter but not the others.

An interesting finding was that we observed significantly higher levels
of distress in men. Most forms of psychological distress tend to show
female excess (REF), however, most studies also have a much higher
participation from women. The difference observed here will need to be
further explored in the future research.

## Conclusions

The purpose of this survey was to capture novel data on
fertility-related awareness, access, and preferences, as well as to
explore associations between fertility and quality of life and mental
health in a diverse sample of childhood, adolescent, and young adult
cancer (CAYA) patients and survivors.

Compromised fertility in young people is one of the most life-altering
late effect of cancer, affecting domains from sexuality and body image
to self-esteem and quality of life [@logan2019b]. While there exist
evidence-based international guidelines for fertility preservation
[@lambertini2020], there is no standardized way of implementing these
guidelines within and between countries across wider Europe. Moreover,
many guidelines continue to be developed without adequate participation
of patients and their caretakers. As such these guidelines and
recommendations might not always be acceptable or sensitive solutions to
the unique young people's needs.

Significant cancer-related fertility inequalities exist among young
cancer patients and survivors between countries and healthcare systems
within and beyond Europe. Accessible fertility preservation programs
should become an integral part of cancer rehabilitation for (C)AYAs and
should actively include them in the development of any novel guidelines.
AYAs' mental health and quality of life may be compromised by
fertility-related distress and should be monitored throughout the cancer
continuum.

## Strengths, limitations and future directions

Our study captures a relatively large sample of CAYA participants and
with targeted survey promotion we achieved an almost even participation
between sexes. Despite these advantages, the sample is self-selected,
highly heterogeneous, and relies on retrospective and self-reported
data, which limits generalizability. Moreover, the survey was
cross-sectional in nature and conducted exclusively in English, which
might have made it less accessible to non-English speaking populations.

Some of the analyses went beyond what was originally pre-registered.
Despite the limited statistical power to perform further breakdowns of
our sample, our results provide meaningful insights and important
directions for future work. Going forward, the studies should try to
follow the same individuals longitudinally and try to capture the
described outcomes from the early diagnosis through to survivorship. We
have identified several important gaps that can be addressed both
clinically and through research. Namely, timely provision of reliable
informational resources about fertility should become the norm across
all countries. Research, particularly in non-Western parts of Europe
should employ translated and validated measures of constructs such as
quality of life and psychological distress. Further identification of
barriers to access is needed.
